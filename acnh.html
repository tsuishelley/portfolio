                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Like everyone else during the pandemic, I struggled with loneliness and took a lot of solace in Animal Crossing New Horizons. I had a strong connection to the franchise having played their earlier release Wild World when I was a kid, and for New Horizons to be released during a time like that felt almost kismet.</p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>One thing I wish I had had on hand while I played was a checklist of what I needed to catch for the museum. For my final front-end development project, I decided to build and design a reference site for players to see what sort of fish, bugs, and sea creatures they are able to catch according to their time-zone and location using the Nookipedia API.</p>

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <p>I added fun microinteractions when the user checked off a critter to make it as satisfying as possible as well as a progress bar to appease the completionist in everyone. I also included the user’s time, season, and hemisphere up at the top when they visited the site — all things that factor into which fish/bugs/sea creatures appear.</p>

                <h2>Features v.2</h2>
                <p>The checklist is sorted by what is currently available to the user when they visit so that way they don’t have to spend time scrolling to check off the critter they need to. I also utilized local storage so that way users save their progress and could refer back to the site whenever they needed.
