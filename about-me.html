                <p class="about-me">It's nice to meet you! My name is Shelley. I graduated from UW in 2021 with a BDes in visual communication design and a minor in informatics.
                    Outside of my 9-5, I love learning new things (like this!), spending time with my husband and pets, and finding as many delicious cake shops as possible in Seattle.
